# Facemask-Detection

## Description
Facemask-Detection is a project that aims to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using computer vision techniques. The project utilizes deep learning models and image processing algorithms to analyze images or video streams and provide predictions regarding the presence or absence of face masks.

This repository contains the source code, pre-trained models, and example data necessary to train and deploy the face mask detection system. It also includes instructions on how to set up the development environment and run the project.

## Features
- Face mask detection in images and real-time video streams
- Support for both single image inference and video stream analysis
- Pre-trained models for quick deployment
- Customizable model training and fine-tuning
- Evaluation metrics to measure the performance of the models

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/gabafo1/Facemask-Detection/
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the pre-trained model weights and place them in the appropriate directory:
   ```
   TODO: Add instructions for model weights download
   ```
4. Set up the necessary configuration files and paths:
   ```
   TODO: Add instructions for configuration setup
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the face mask detection on an image:
   ```
   python detect_image.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
   ```
2. Analyze real-time video streams for face mask detection:
   ```
   python detect_video.py --video_path path/to/video.mp4
   ```
   Note: If no video path is specified, the script will use the default camera.

## Training
1. Prepare the dataset by organizing images into two separate folders: 'with_mask' and 'without_mask'.
2. Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
3. Fine-tune the pre-trained model or train a new model using the provided scripts.
   ```
   python train.py --train_data path/to/train_data --val_data path/to/val_data
   ```
4. Monitor the training progress and adjust hyperparameters as needed.

## Evaluation
1. Evaluate the performance of the trained models using various metrics:
   ```
   python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/model --test_data path/to/test_data
   ```
2. Analyze the evaluation results, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
